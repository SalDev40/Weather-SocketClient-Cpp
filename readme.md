Client.cpp

	  Will connect  with  your server and send it requests for the weather report for a given city. Will create a stream socket, and connect  to the specified server. Outputs either the error or result sent by the server

	Create  a  stream socket, bind  it  to  the specified  port  number, 
	do  a listen() to specify a maximum number of queued connection requests and do an
	accept() that will let it wait for connection requests. Retrieves data from and client
	and respond with either an error or the dayâ€™s maximum temperature and sky condition.



How to Run:
